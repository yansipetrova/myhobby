        <p>
            Тъй като ми е много трудно да изрязявам чувствата и емоциите си, реших да кача тези рандъм цитати или мисли, които описват тоно как се 
            чувствам спрямо книгите.

                    Some girls dream of a big walk-in closed in their bedroom.
                    I’d prefer a walk-in library in mine.

                    The problem with reading a good book is that you want to finish the book, but you don’t want to finish the book.

                    That moment when you finish a book, look around, and realize that everyone is just carrying on with their lives… 
                    as though you didn’t just experience emotional trauma at the hands of a paperback.

                    I never cease to be amazed by books. Seriously. Just think about it: thousands of people read 
                    the same book but in each one’s mind the characters look different and the setting changes and we’re all 
                    reading the same thing but it’s so unique to each of us. That is insanely cool.

                    The thing about reading is that, in that very moment, while your nose is stuck in that book, all your 
                    troubles fade and you and your book are the only two things that exist in the world.

                    Books are the plane, and the train, and the road. They are the destination, and the journey. They are home.

            The synopsis looked good,<br>
            The cover looked nice,<br>
            You open the book, <br>
            And began a new life.<br>
            You found a new home,<br>
            you met some new friends,<br>
            you kept on reading,<br>
            hoping it would never end.<br>
            You danced through the pages,<br>
            you sang out the words,<br>
            you felt all their joy, <br>
            and all their pain and hurt.<br>
            The pages cut your fingers,<br>
            and the words cut your heart,<br>
            like the author had a knife,<br>
            and was tearing your soul apart.<br>
            You laughed with the characters,<br>
            and with them you cried,<br>
            you fell in love with them, too,<br>
            but with them you died,<br>
            and when the book reached its end, <br>
            and your broken heart couldn’t heal,<br>
            you suddenly realized that <br>
            it’s <br>
            not <br>
            real. <br>
