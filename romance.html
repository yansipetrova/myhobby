                <h2>Icebreaker</h2>
                <h3>by Hannah Grace</h3>
                <p>Anastasia Allen has worked her entire life for a shot at Team USA.</p>
                <p> A competitive figure skater since she was five years old, a full college scholarship thanks to her place on the Maple Hills skating team, and a schedule that would make even the most driven person weep, Stassie comes to win.</p>
                <p>No exceptions.</p>
                <p>Nathan Hawkins has never had a problem he couldn’t solve. As captain of the Maple Hills Titans, he knows the responsibility of keeping the hockey team on the ice rests on his shoulders.</p>
                <p>When a misunderstanding results in the two teams sharing a rink, and Anastasia’s partner gets hurt in the aftermath, Nate finds himself swapping his stick for tights, and one scary coach for an even scarier one.</p>
                <p>The pair find themselves stuck together in more ways than one, but it’s fine, because Anastasia doesn’t even like hockey players…right?</p></p>

                <h2>The Wall of Winnipeg and me</h2>
                <h3>by Mariana Zapata</h3>
                <p>Vanessa Mazur knows she's doing the right thing. She shouldn't feel bad for quitting. Being an assistant/housekeeper/fairy godmother to the top defensive end in the National Football Organization was always supposed to be temporary. She has plans and none of them include washing extra-large underwear longer than necessary.</p>
                <p>But when Aiden Graves shows up at her door wanting her to come back, she's beyond shocked.</p>
                <p>For two years, the man known as The Wall of Winnipeg couldn't find it in him to tell her good morning or congratulate her on her birthday. Now? He's asking for the unthinkable.</p>
                <p>What do you say to the man who is used to getting everything he wants?</p>

                <h2>From Lukov with love</h2>
                <h3>by Mariana Zapata</h3>
                <p>If someone were to ask Jasmine Santos to describe the last few years of her life with a single word, it would definitely be a four-letter one.</p>
                <p>After seventeen years—and countless broken bones and broken promises—she knows her window to compete in figure skating is coming to a close.</p>
                <p>But when the offer of a lifetime comes in from an arrogant idiot she’s spent the last decade dreaming about pushing in the way of a moving bus, Jasmine might have to reconsider everything.</p>
                <p>Including Ivan Lukov.</p>
